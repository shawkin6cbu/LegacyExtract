time period in L. 100 to negotiate repairs. Buyer(s) reserve(s) the right to exercise options (a) or (b) at any time during the time period
set forth in L. 100 if activated by Buyer’s)(s’) proper compliance with subsection (c).

learning disabilities, reduced intelligence quotient, behavioral problems, and impaired memory. Lead poisoning also poses a
particular risk to pregnant women. The Seller of any interest in residential real property is required to provide the Buyer with any

money (i.e., wire transfers, direct deposits, electronic checks, etc.). NEVER transfer funds associated with this transaction based
upon electronic communications (such as email) that have not been verbally confirmed by you to be valid (from a person you know
and trust) and accurate. Email scammers can disguise emails, text messages and social media messages to appear to be from your
real estate agent, title companies, attorneys, your bank or other parties. Do not trust any communication you receive concerning
transfer of funds without taking steps to verify that these funds are, in fact, going to the proper recipient. Do not use telephone
numbers or email addresses in electronic communications you receive; they may be fraudulent and part of a scam. VERIFY
telephone numbers, contact people and wiring instructions BEFORE you respond. Fraudulent communications or acts should be
reported immediately to the FBI and law enforcement authorities, and should be done so immediately if funds are lost. By signing
this Contract, Buyer and Seller acknowledge receipt of this notice and agree to hold the brokerages and their agents harmless
from all claims for damages arising out of or relating to inaccurate transfer instructions, fraudulent taking of such funds, and
any and all other damages relating to conduct of third parties influencing or handling implementation of wire transfers.
